## I.  Rationale

Unlike any time before in our lives, we have access to vast amounts of free information––a phenomena scholars  refer to as “[big data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data).” With the right tools, we can start to make sense of all this data to see patterns and trends that would otherwise be invisible to us. By transforming numbers into graphical shapes and interactive web apps, we can allow users to understand the stories those numbers hide. This process of gaining new insights from data and crafting visual stories to convey that data in an accessible and engaging format is part of what we call “*[data journalism](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/)”–– *a specialty subset of journalism that reflects the increased role that numerical data is used in the production and distribution of information in the digital era. 

Data journalism, which typically uses *[visualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_visualization) *as its primary means of communication,  has rapidly emerged during the past decade as an in-demand skill-set across nearly all sectors of digital media, helping audiences understand complex social and public policy issues ranging from climate change, to the U.S. Electoral College, to the growing the influence of money in politics. Yet more recently –– as the majority of users worldwide now access the web via mobile devices with smaller screen sizes and touch-screen interfaces ––  the task of creating clear, usable and truthful data visualizations has taken on an added level of complexity. We now find ourselves forced to squeeze large amounts of data into limited screen real-estate, and having to rethink the way we approach the workflow of data journalism on a fundamental level to account for what we call *[responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)* techniques. Developing theoretical models –– and possibly even practical solutions to –– this broader challenge of displaying big data on small screens will, thus, act as a potential solutions-based lens through which we approach this course as we learn the history, theory, guidelines and basic technical workflow of data journalism.* *

## II. Overview and Learning Outcomes

This four-credit hour lecture and lab course will approach data journalism from both a scholarly perspective and a technical perspective. The course thus has two primary learning goals:

*  To analyze the historical, theoretical, statistical and ethical principles behind the nascent field of [data journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_journalism) by engaging with key texts in the fields of information design, interactive visualization, computer-assisted reporting (CAR) and what Phillip Meyer calls “precision journalism.”
* To impart basic-to-intermediate technical skill-sets needed to tell data-driven stories visually and interactively on all screen sizes and devices via responsive design techniques.  

Part information design, part basic statistics, part computer science, part data science and part shoe-leather reporting, students should leave this course with a thorough grasp of both the *process* and the *product* of obtaining, processing, analyzing and visualizing massive datasets and spreadsheets to convey an accurate and cohesive visual narrative to a non-professional audience on large and small screen sizes alike.** Students are not expected to become technical  experts in data journalism, much less in responsive data visualization, by taking this course alone.**  Understanding the *concepts *behind* *the tools we use for data journalism is more important than learning any one discrete tool itself. Likewise, acquiring practical knowledge of computational technology can only reach its full potential when undergirded by sound academic theory on how we interact with data displays — as journalists, as media consumers, and citizens of the world. 

That said, the successful student will complete this course having learned the following technical and analytical skills on a basic level:

* How to locate and retrieve data from the web in the correct format for the task at hand and, alternatively, how to request data from government agencies via a FOIA request— or what makes up a process analogous to “finding sources” in traditional reporting.
* The use of spreadsheets for data analysis, formatting, manipulation, tabulation and exploration — or what Derek Willis [calls](http://dwillis.github.io/interviewing-data/) “interviewing” the data.
* The journalistic ability to find the data *lede — *or main story — amid large, raw datasets often obscured by extraneous data and information overload.
* The statistical ability to “fact-check” what the data appears to indicate by calculating the level of correlation, standard deviation and other important values such as the *median*, *range, [z-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score)* and *p-value.*
* The application of [computational thinking](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15110-s13/Wing06-ct.pdf), [numeracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeracy), [graphicacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphicacy) and a 'data mindset'
* How to analyze and critique visualizations in newspapers, books, TV, etc., and how to propose alternatives that would improve them.
* A general grasp of best practices for selecting the appropriate visualization type that conveys the story at hand (a.k.a., choosing the right chart type).
* The role of visual perception of size, space, distance, position and color in giving meaning to data visualizations — and how those visual elements can distort the truth if used improperly.
* The power of design to enhance cognition and usability (emotional design, human-centered design) or, alternatively, when implemented for the sake of aesthetics alone, abstract and complicate the presentation, causing [information overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload).
* The workflow of creating a basic modern web app (HTML, CSS, JS).
* The primary file formats of data storage for spreadsheets ([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)), geospatial information ([SHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile), [KML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language), [GeoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), [TopoJSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON#TopoJSON)) and fast-scaling data for web applications ([APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface): [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML)).
* Useful [current tools](http://dataviz.tools/) to speed up and reduce the programming knowledge necesssary to create basic-to-intermediate complexity visualizations.
* General strategies to apply responsive design techniques to data visualizations *when possible*.

These are merely meant as *predicted* outcomes for taking this course, not definitive requirements. The level of depth we reach will vary depending upon the class' ability to keep pace.

No specific prerequisite courses nor prior programming knowledge is necessary to take this course, but at least one (1) introductory-level reporting class or equivalent journalistic experience is recommended. While the subject matter may seem complex or daunting at first, I assure you that—with a little enthusiasm and self-belief coupled with sincere effort—you will eventually have an “Aha!” moment and get it. Trust me,* it's not rocket science*, but I'm confident it can be just as rewarding as rocket science if you come into class open-minded and eager to learn.

## III A Disclaimer on Technologies and Tools Covered

While specific data journalism tools and technologies fluctuate rapidly, this course will – for purposes of experience and workflow – cover the real-world application of current “Web 2.0” responsive data visualization technologies and standards. These conventions include the basic building blocks of a modern native web app –– HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript –– as well as the most commonly used data storage formats in currency today: CSV (comma-separated-value files) and JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). We'll also examine a number of JavaScript *libraries* (basically, collections of goodies) for responsive data journalism such as [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.org/).

 If any or all of these terms sound scary or foreign to you at the start of the course, **do not fear:** You will not be expected to leave this course as a JavaScript engineer, nor a data scientist, nor a web developer. But you will be expected to carry out simple, guided in-class assignments that will help you to begin to understand how these various technologies appear in text (or, more precisely, code) and how they interact together to render a web page in the modern browser. **In addition, if you at any point feel like you  need extra help understanding *any* concept or technology outside of class, you are encouraged to schedule one-on-one instruction time with me using the schedule reservation booking page at the beginning of this syllabus. **Please allow 24 hours before an upcoming deadline to schedule a meeting to ensure you leave adequate time for us to meet. As your instructor, I will be acting in a role as both educator and editor.
 
For data journalism *production* purposes, we'll primarily be employing a number of open-source, graphical, drag-and-drop tools that require little-to-no coding knowledge, and instead focus the bulk of our efforts more upon data sourcing, processing, analysis, design and presentation. *That said, we will still be conducting regular exercises and assignments that introduce basic programming concepts and practices*, as graphical user interface tools cannot in all cases do all the heavy lifting for us. The more complex the dataset, the higher the likelihood some coding may be needed (and, in turn, the higher the likelihood you will need to harness the interactive power of JavaScript).

## IV.  Course Materials

Each class will include different assigned readings from mostly free online sources (blog posts, essays, social media threads, open-source e-books or excerpts from other scholarly sources) made available for download or linked to on the course website and on Blackboard.

That said, five (5) books will be required for purchase or loan for the duration of the course: 

1. Cairo, Alberto. *The Functional Art: An Introduction to Information Graphics and Visualization. *Berkeley, CA :New Riders, 2013. Print.
2. Norman, Don. *The Design of Everyday Things. *Basic Books, 2013. Print.
3. Mollerup, Per. *Data Design: Visualising quantities, locations, connections*. Bloomsbury, 2015. Print.
4. Learning Responsive Data Visualization
5. Numbers in the Newsroom.

The three titles above will all be available in the Campus Bookstore, all less than $20.00 each. In addition, students will be expected to download and have on-hand the full-text of two free e-books:

1.  *The Data Journalism Handbook: How Journalists Can Use Numbers to Improve the News *from O'Reilly Press (available for free download at [datajournalismhandbook.com](http://datajournalismhandbook.com/)). 
2. Chiasson, Trina and Dyanna Gregory. (2015) *Data+Design: A simple introduction to preparing and visualizing information. *Infoactive*. *(available for free download at https://infoactive.co/data-design/)

We will also read blog posts and brief excerpts from a number of other works on the subjects of information design and data journalism, which are partially listed at the end of the syllabus and which will also be made available on the course website and Blackboard.

All software used will be freeware or open-source licensed for educational use, with the exception of Microsoft Excel and Adobe Creative Suite, both of which are available on lab computers in the event you do not own copies yourself.

## V. Course Deliverables and Projects

No exams or quizzes will be administered as a part of this course. Your grade hinges entirely upon the quality of the data journalism you produce, the intellectual rigor of your critiques and reading responses, and the level of participation you demonstrate by offering meaningful class discussion.

Course grades will be determined by weighing the scores for each of  the following deliverables:

* **WEEKLY DATA JOURNALISM CRITIQUES - 10% OF FINAL COURSE GRADE**: Offer one (1) thoughtful, well-articulated  critique of a popular and/or novel example of data journalism of your choice each week in the form of a roughly two-hundred fifty (250) word blog post published no later than 8 a.m. the morning before each Monday class. The piece of data journalism you critique can be something you see in the news that week, or any memorable digital artifact you can find that blends design, data and interaction. Each Monday, at the start of class, two students will be chosen beforehand based upon the quality of their blog critiques and the novelty of the examples they find to present their critiques and findings briefly to the class for discussion.
* **BLOG POST RESPONSES TO CLASS READINGS** -** 20% OF FINAL COURSE GRADE:** Reflect critically upon assigned readings for each class, and compose one (1) roughly two-hundred fifty (250) word blog post response prior to each class on that day's assigned reading(s). The reading responses must be posted to your class blog no later than 10 a.m. the morning *before* each class. *A high-scoring blog post will do more than summarize or paraphrase the author's argument. *It will, instead, seek to confront the text(s) at hand critically and with logically sound evidence. It will either (a) form an opinion in favor of or in opposition to the author's claims, backed by concrete examples, (b) evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of the author's logic, or (c) compare/contrast the author's stated views with that of another scholar or practioner's work. **Do not attempt to craft your responses without having first read the text(s).** **Your attempts _will_ not go unnoticed. **Discussing off-topic subjects, employing vague generalizations, failing to cite specific evidence from the text, or simply restating the author's introductory argument, among other ploys, are all red flags of posts written without having read the assigned text. Such ruses meant to shirk assigned readings can be easily detected, and will be pointed out to the student – especially if occurring more than once – in private email feedback. While no formal numeric scores will be assigned to individual blog posts, weak or shallow responses will result in a commensurate deduction in the 'reading responses' component of your final grade (which, again, accounts for 20% of your course grade). In addition, missing more than five (5) reading responses and/or composing more than seven (7) responses that reflect a clear failure to have read the text will automatically render your *reading response* grade as zero (0), and could also lead to subsequent deductions in the *participation *component of your course grade as well (which also accounts for another 20 percent). This means, in theory, failing to read assigned texts and, thus, failing to compose sufficiently critical reading responses could, on its own, trigger an automatic D or F in the course. Feedback on reading responses will take place via occasional comments on your blog posts or, if necessary, private email correspondence. So, please, take the readings seriously—even if they may seem unrelated at the time to the more practical components of the course, I assure you they will tie in if you allow yourself to absorb them enough to recognize their practical applications. *In the highly unlikely event the majority of the class at any point reflects a continued pattern of failure to meet the minimum bar for critically-analyzed blog responses, the instructor reserves the right to begin instituting reading quizzes at the beginning of each class **in addition** to composing the responses already required. I neither expect nor want this to happen, as rote memorization of facts or concepts is not the goal of this course, and quizzes can cause undue anxiety that may distract students from absorbing the meaning of the readings. But, I feel compelled to add this cautionary disclaimer to the syllabus should it come to that point at any time.*

* **LAB TUTORIAL WORK - 10% OF FINAL COURSE GRADE:** Follow along with in-class/lab programming, data analysis, statistical and visualization tutorials and submit finished work from each tutorial via email no later than the start of the next class meeting. Tutorials will be paced in a manner that you should reasonably be able to complete them in-class as they are given. They will also as a failsafe be made available as screencasts uploaded to the class website for later review. But, if you still encounter difficulty completing the tutorial work before the next class, I encourage you to schedule time to meet with me outside of class for further assistance. I am more than happy to help.
* **'DEADLINE' DATA JOURNALISM PROJECTS - 30% OF FINAL COURSE GRADE:** Produce a total of three (3) individual 'deadline' data journalism/data visualization projects that might be reasonably produced in 1-2 days of full-time work on a topic of current interest. Projects may take the form of an interactive chart, map, dashboard, data-driven game/animation or other visualization, and should include any necessary explanatory text or reporting to compliment the visualization. The projects will be evaluated on technique, design, clarity, truthfulness and the integrity of the underlying data and the story being told (*Note***: ***Each project is not necessarily weighed equally here --greater weight will be assigned to higher scoring projects; thus, if you score poorly on your first project and then exceedingly well on your second and third, you could still in theory receive a high score overall in this category).*
* **PARTICIPATION AND DISCUSSION - 20% OF FINAL COURSE GRADE:** Participate meaningfully in class discussions on peer critiques and assigned readings and — to a lesser extent — during lab tutorials. This does not mean participation for the sake of participation. This means offering insightful, unique, critical analysis of the text and/or subject at hand that either contributes and furthers discussion or raises otherwise new insights. You will be given formal written feedback from me regarding your performance in this aspect of the course three times during the semester: once at week six (6), again at week twelve (12), then once again two (2) weeks prior to the end of term. Because data journalism is almost always a collaborative effort that requires a 'data mindset,' your ability to speak fluently the language of data, the web, and visual communications in a group setting is of paramount importance.
* **FINAL GROUP PROJECT - 20% OF FINAL COURSE GRADE:** By the end of the course, you should be able to contribute meaningfully to a final group project that takes the form of a data-driven news application that allows for dynamic data exploration among multiple hierarchies of information and responds appropriately to a range of screen sizes . Accompanying the visual(s) may or may not be a textual. image-based and/or video narrative describing the effects and providing human voices to complement the story conveyed by the data. You may here also cite anecdotal evidence such as original reporting, including remarks from individuals who  specialize in the topic of your project. This project will be presented in front of a panel of well-known data and visual journalists one (1) week prior to its final due date (Dec. 14) so that judges may offer constructive feedback on ways you might improve your project before it is officially submitted to me via email. Upon each group member's written consent, I intend to publish the final projects on a dedicated server and domain under the team's bylines, as well as to make them available as open-source repositories on GitHub.

### Assessment BREAKDOWN

**Reading Response Evaluation Criteria:**

* *Clear Thesis* – One-third (1/3).
* *Thoughtful Thesis *– One-third (1/3)
* *Illustrative Examples/Textual Evidence* – One-third (1/3)

**Data Journalism Critiques Evaluation Criteria:**

* *Timeliness and/or novelty of chosen visualization* – One-third (1/3).
* *Critical analysis of strengths and/or weaknesses of visualization *– One-third (1/3)
* *Suggestions for how visualization might be improved or, alternatively, ways in which it might have distorted the true visual meaning were it not well-thought out* – One-third (1/3)

**Deadline Data Journalism Projects Evaluation Criteria:**

* *Effective use of data in conveying relevant information related to narrative *– One-third (1/3).
* *Use of appropriate visual display of data (i.e. picking the right chart/medium, using color appropriately,  *– One-third (1/3)
* *Clarity and truthfulness of visuals - *One-third (1/3)

**Final Group Project Assessment Criteria:**

* *What is the story, why is it important, what data backs up conclusions? Is this publish-ready? - *One-third (1/3)
* *Ability to improve project after feedback from judges *– One-third (1/3).
* *Use of multimodal communicative media, if appropriate - *One-third (1/3)

### Redo Policy

Given that data visualization is an inherently visual specialization often best critiqued by redesign, you will each get one chance to redesign or “redo” any single one (1) of the three (3) deadline data journalism projects if you are unhappy with your initial score. This effectively allows you to use the feedback given to you from me to improve the visualization design and/or journalistic strength of your original project and submit it again for re-evaluation within ten (10) days of the date the project score and feedback was returned to you. You also will receive one (1) free pass to use should you fail to submit a critique/reading before deadline. With this pass, as long as you complete the post within one week of the due date, you will not be penalized for the late submission.  

Final course grades will be determined using the standard academic format rounding to the nearest integer: A=90-100%, B+=85-89%, B=80-84%, C+=75=79%, C=70-74%, D=60-70% and <60%=F.

*As the course components above suggest, this course aims to blend theory/discussion equally with practice/production of actual data journalism. Producing stellar works of data journalism but failing to post reading responses and critiques – or participate in class dicussion – will **not** be sufficient to succeed in this course. Likewise, diligent blog posts and participation without a sincere attempt to put theory into practice with actual data journalism projects will also **not** meet criteria for course success.*

## VI. Attendance Policy and Other Miscellaneous Stipulations 

More than three (3) unexcused absences from lectures or lab time will automatically render your participation grade (which accounts for 20% of your total grade) as zero (0). More than eight (8) unexcused absences will automatically trigger failure of the class.

Given that a large component of the class is structured around your blog post responses and critiques, I will offer feedback regularly in the form of posting comments to your blog entries. It is recommended but in no way mandated that you use [WordPress](http://wordpress.com/), [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com/) or [Ghost](http://ghost.org/) to host your blog; whatever platform or site architecture you choose, ensure I and your classmates can access it and leave meaningful comments. If a blog post is deemed to lack sufficient evidence of having read the text, and thus not deserving of serious critical commentary, I will instead email you with feedback privately. If you receive a comment on the post from me, consider that as effectively the equivalent of an 'A' for that day's response. If you receive neither a comment nor negative private feedback, that means you successfully showed evidence of having read the text that day and should not have cause for concern. I generally will attempt to leave a constructive comment on one of your posts at least once every two (2) weeks if you are successfully carrying them out.

As previously mentioned, in-lab tutorial work should be submitted via email, and all blog post responses and critiques will be submitted by posting them directly to your blog (I will begin checking for posts at 8 a.m., so altering the published time on posts won't work if late—but nice try!). Any work submitted past the stated deadline will at most receive a fifty (50) score and may receive as low as zero (0) at the discretion of the instructor.

Because this course will focus heavily on ensuring all or mostly all produced data visualizations adapt to a variety of different screen sizes, the use of mobile phones in class will be permitted as a prototyping tool during lab times to test  visualizations (having said that, please respect the time of your peers and do not use your phone to text, Snapchat or carry out any other unrelated social communication during lab times or lectures ad nauseum; *doing so overtly will result in an automatic deduction of twenty points from your participation score). *

You are welcome to bring your own laptop to class or to use the lab computers. If bringing your own machine, please either ensure it is running the Mac OS X operating system, or that you can follow along using the operating system you have without falling behind. We will be using MacOSX Sierra for purposes of in-class tutorials, along with Sublime Text (free; [sublimetext.com](http://sublimetext.com/)), iTerm2 (free; [iterm2.com](http://iterm2.com/)), Cyberduck (free; [Cyberduck.io](http://cyberduck.io/)) and Tableau Public (free; [http://public.tableau.com](http://public.tableau.com/)). You'll also want to create a Google account in the incredibly rare event you don't already have one, as we'll be using [Google Sheets](http://sheets.google.com/) for most spreadsheet-related data analysis. *For a more thorough list of possible tools and technologies you may wish to use in your individual and group work, I have previously put together a collection of curated tools for students of data journalism and data visualization technologies to use at [http://dataviz.tools](http://dataviz.tools/). Or , you may always ask me for a solution during lab time or office hours if unable to find help elsewhere.*

## VII. Academic Integrity

Each student in this course is expected to abide by the UF Code of Academic Integrity. Any work submitted by a student in this course for academic credit will be the student's own work. 

You are encouraged to study together and to discuss information and concepts covered in lecture and the sections with other students. You can give "consulting" help to or receive "consulting" help from such students. However, this permissible cooperation should never involve one student having possession of a copy of all or part of work done by someone else, in the form of an e-mail, an e-mail attachment file, a flash drive or a hard copy. Specifically in regard to lab tutorial work, it is important that you show the process of your work, as the entire class will ultimately be creating the same visualization.

Should copying occur, both the student who copied work from another student and the student who gave material to be copied will both automatically receive a zero (0) for the assignment. Penalty for violation of this Code can also be extended to include failure of the course and University disciplinary action.

## VII. Diversity

The UF College of Journalism and  Communications values diversity, in the broadest sense of the word – gender, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, income, religion, education, geographic, physical and mental ability or disability, sexual orientation. We recognize that understanding and incorporating diversity in the curriculum enables us to prepare our students for careers as professional communicators in a global society. As communicators, we understand that journalism, advertising and other forms of strategic communication must reflect society in order to be effective and reliable. We fail as journalists if we are not accurate in our written, spoken and visual reports; including diverse voices and perspectives improves our accuracy and truthfulness. In advertising, we cannot succeed if we do not understand the value of or know how to create advertising that reflects a diverse society and, thus, appeals to broader audiences.

## VII. Course Schedule and Format

This course is inherently interdisciplinary, combining elements of design, statistics, computer science, human-computer interaction and communication studies. But it is still, at its core, a *journalism* course in the sense that its key aim is to help students learn how to distill complex information of public or societal importance into a cogent and engaging narrative for users. In that regard, then, the course schedule or reading list may be subject to change in response to a major news event, the publication of a relevant piece of scholarship that contributes to the flow of class discussion, or the release of a new technology that expands the possibilities of individual or group projects.  

The schedule will be embedded as a auto-updating Google Document into the course website as well as on Blackboard, and will be modified as we proceed to reflect any changes or recalibration of the curriculum pace that may occur. In the event any changes do occur, I will notify the class immediately via email.

### Disclaimer on Fair Use of Copyrighted Materials: 

*Any assigned readings from copyrighted works n**ot listed for purchase in Section IV of this syllabus will take the form of short excerpts which I will provide for you on Blackboard in PDF form at least three (3) weeks prior to the date of the class. The reproduction and distribution of these excerpts conforms as closely as possible to current “Fair Use” educational [guidelines](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ21.pdf) set forth by the U.S. Copyright Office. As such, it is incumbent upon you, the student, not to redistribute these materials outside of the classroom in digital or print form for any non-class related purposes during or after course completion. This restriction does not apply to non-copyrighted resources or readings directly openly available and linked to on the web in the schedule below.*
